# DB-ENCRYPTOR

**This project is designed to encrypt entire database tables and their data using the Base64 encoding scheme. It is implemented using PHP for backend processing and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for the frontend interface.**

## Overview

The Database Encryption Project aims to enhance the security of sensitive data stored in database tables by encrypting them using the Base64 encoding scheme. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, the data remains encrypted and unreadable to unauthorized users.

## Features

- **Table Encryption:** Encrypts entire database tables to protect the data stored within.
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypts individual data entries within the tables using Base64 encoding.
- **PHP Backend:** Handles encryption and decryption operations on the server-side.
- **HTML/CSS/JS Frontend:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the encryption functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Used for backend processing and encryption/decryption operations.
- **HTML, CSS:** Structure and styling of the frontend interface.
- **JavaScript, jQuery:** Enhances frontend interactivity and handles client-side operations.
